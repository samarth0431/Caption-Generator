This project aims to convert speech content from video files into text format using two distinct approaches: leveraging the powerful Wav2Vec2 model by Hugging Face and utilizing Google's speech recognition API. The implementation involves extracting audio from video files, segmenting it based on silence, and transcribing these segments into text. The Wav2Vec2 model, known for its high accuracy, utilizes a self-supervised learning approach, while the Google API provides a simpler and more accessible solution. However, both models exhibit certain limitations. Wav2Vec2 demands significant computational resources and domain-specific fine-tuning for optimal performance, whereas the Google API may lack accuracy in complex or specialized content and could be affected by external service dependencies. The project conducts a risk analysis for both models, addressing concerns related to computational resources, data privacy, accuracy, and dependency on external services. Mitigation strategies include diversification, continuous monitoring, hybrid approaches, and compliance with data privacy regulations. Understanding the strengths and limitations of each approach is crucial for selecting the appropriate model based on factors like accuracy requirements, resource availability, and domain specificity. By integrating these methodologies, this project aims to offer reliable and efficient speech-to-text transcription solutions for a range of applications, with an understanding of the trade-offs involved in each approach
